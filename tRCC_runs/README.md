## Preprocessing

1. The truncated maf files for the tRCC samples used here were generated by running GATK funcotator.
2. The seg data comes from seg files generated by Titan run.
3. The columns of maf- "Hugo_Symbol", "Chromosome", "Start_position", "Reference_Allele", "Tumor_Seq_Allele2", "t_ref_count", "t_alt_count" were combined with columns from Titan seg files "Corrected_MajorCN",	"Corrected_MinorCN" based on the variant chr co-ordinates lying in the range between chr start and end position of seg files.
4. To match the format columns of PhylogicNDT runs, the column names were changed from "Corrected_MajorCN" and	"Corrected_MinorCN" to "local_cn_a1" and "local_cn_a2"

## Notes

Make sure that the headings are exactly the same to what PhylogicNDT example data or else there will be error while running.
